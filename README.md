# Boolean-Function-Analyzer-and-Truth-Table-Generator
A Java-based project that processes Boolean functions from a file, generates their corresponding truth tables, and expresses the functions as sums of minterms and products of maxterms. The project includes functionality to evaluate Boolean expressions, extract variables, and display results in a structured format.
